/*
WHAT THIS DOES: This script extracts raw activity data from Salesforce with minimal transformation:
- Pulls all activity records from the Salesforce Activity__c object
- Applies basic data quality filters to remove invalid records
- Preserves original field names and data structure
- Organizes data by creation date for logical processing
- Sets up the foundation for all intermediate and production models
